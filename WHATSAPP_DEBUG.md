# WhatsApp Integration Test & Debug Guide

## What was Fixed:

### 1. **Main Issue - Hardcoded WhatsApp URL**
- **Problem**: The WhatsApp URL was changed to a hardcoded link that didn't include the product details
- **Fix**: Restored the dynamic URL generation with message parameters

### 2. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added console logging to track what data is being captured
- Added URL logging to verify the final WhatsApp link
- Added parameter validation

## How to Test:

### 1. **Open Browser Console**
- Press F12 in your browser
- Go to the Console tab
- Keep it open while testing

### 2. **Test Product Buttons**
- Click on any "Buy Now" button on the main page
- Click on any "Order on WhatsApp" button on the categories page
- Check the console for debug output

### 3. **What to Look For in Console:**

**Expected Output:**
```

Please provide more details about availability and ordering process.

WhatsApp URL: https://wa.me/917979914985?text=...
```

## Troubleshooting:

### If Product Name Shows as "Product":
- The h4 element wasn't found
- Check if product card structure matches expected format

### If Description Shows as "Premium resin art creation":
- The description element wasn't found
- This is the fallback text

### If Image URL is Empty:
- No image element was found in the product card
- Check if images are loading properly

### If WhatsApp Doesn't Open:
- Check if the phone number format is correct
- Verify the URL in console logs

## Current Configuration:
- **Phone Number**: +917979914985
- **Business Name**: Memory & More

## Manual Test URL:
You can manually test with this URL:
```
https://wa.me/917979914985?text=Hi!%20Test%20message%20from%20Memory%20%26%20More
```

## Next Steps:
1. Test the functionality with console open
2. Share the console output if issues persist
3. Verify WhatsApp opens with the correct message
4. Check if all product details (name, description, image, price) appear in the message
