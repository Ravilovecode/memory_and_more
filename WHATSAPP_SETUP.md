# WhatsApp Integration Setup

## Overview
The website now includes WhatsApp sharing functionality for all product buttons. When users click on the "Buy Now" or "Order on WhatsApp" buttons, it will automatically open WhatsApp with a pre-filled message containing product details.

## Configuration

### Setting Up Your WhatsApp Number

1. **Main Page (index.html)**: Edit `script.js`
2. **Categories Page (categories.html)**: Edit `categories.js`

In both files, find the `WHATSAPP_CONFIG` object at the top and update it:

```javascript
const WHATSAPP_CONFIG = {
    ownerNumber: '+919876543210', // Replace with your actual WhatsApp number
    businessName: 'Memory & More'  // Your business name
};
```

### WhatsApp Number Format
- Include the country code (e.g., +91 for India)
- Example formats:
  - `+919876543210` (India)
  - `+1234567890` (US)
  - `+447123456789` (UK)

## How It Works

### User Experience
1. User clicks on "Buy Now" or "Order on WhatsApp" button
2. Button shows "Sending..." feedback
3. WhatsApp opens in a new tab/window with pre-filled message
4. Message includes:
   - Product name
   - Product description
   - Price information
   - Product image URL
   - Request for more details
